## Hey there!

I'm Mahadev, a technology enthusiast, student and city-dweller who loves travelling, playing guitar, partaking in outdoor activities and finding adventures along the way. I love problem-solving in the field of computing and software design since high school, and found solutions to modern-day complexities in business, scientific and social contexts, as the ability to identify and solve problems, is one of the key reasons we continue to grow and thrive. I enjoy creating web applications. I have done freelancing and internships during my graduation days as a software developer, which provided me with a real experience on SDLC, and also motivated me to explore Smart Automations and the full efficacy of  Artificial Intelligence. 

My leadership journey begins with becoming a Student volunteer for a technical club called Sketch in my college to being promoted as a Student President of the club, which improved my leadership and teamwork abilities. As a student president, I have conducted various workshops, technical events and mentorship programmes for my fellow junior students. I have participated in hackathons and tech fests, which helped me in network building and community engagements. I have done freelancing for many startup companies and NGO projects as a full-stack developer, which led to the beginning of our startup named Ecstasy Creatives where I started my career as a Freelance Full-stack Developer to becoming a CTO. Working as a CTO has helped me gain experience in the domain of software development by working on projects and managing technical operations.

<b>I find nothing to satisfy me more than meeting new people, developing new relations and expanding my network.</b>
