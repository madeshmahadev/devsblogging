A month ago, Google Play removed an app called "Craftsart Cartoon Photo Tools" after the cyber security company Pradeo found the app was stealing users' Facebook credentials. 

The app with 100k downloads mimics the behaviours of popular legitimate photo editing applications but is injected with a small piece of code that easily slips under the radar of Play Store's security policies. 

The injected code was an Andriod Trojan called "Facestealer" that uses Social Engineering to steal Facebook credentials and make connections to a Russian Server. The company Pradeo reported that the app gives threat actors full access to victims' Facebook accounts.
